# Database Data Processing With DAO

This project, Database Data Processing With DAO, is designed to efficiently handle data from databases using the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. It focuses on implementing SOLID principles and GRASP patterns, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling. The system interacts with relational databases through JDBC and facilitates various data processing tasks.

## Overview

The Database Data Processing With DAO system is built upon the DAO design pattern, which separates the data access logic from business logic and presentation layers. Each entity class utilizes the Builder pattern for construction, ensuring flexibility and readability. The Singleton pattern is employed for classes handling CRUD operations, providing a single point of access to the database. Additionally, The Factory Method pattern is utilized for creating instances of DAO classes, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Task

- Implement SOLID and GRASP principles using the DAO design pattern.
- Utilize the Builder pattern for entity classes for flexible object creation.
- Apply the Singleton pattern to classes implementing CRUD operations for centralized database access.
- Use the Factory Method pattern for creating DAO instances to maintain consistency.
- Implement custom exceptions for scenarios such as record not found to handle potential errors gracefully.

## Database Schema

The database schema for the Database Data Processing With DAO system comprises multiple tables, each representing an entity in the domain model. The schema includes tables for entities like Animals, Enclosures, Employees, Visitors, and any additional entities required to model the domain accurately.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Database Data Processing With DAO system follows these guidelines:
- Each entity class implements the Builder pattern for object construction, providing flexibility and readability.
- Classes responsible for CRUD operations utilize the Singleton pattern to ensure a single instance for database access.
- The Simple Factory or Factory Method pattern is used to create instances of DAO classes, promoting consistency and maintainability.
- Custom exceptions are implemented to handle scenarios such as record not found, ensuring graceful error handling.

## Testing

Functional testing of the Database Data Processing With DAO system is conducted using dedicated test classes. Test data is used to validate CRUD operations and ensure data integrity across the system.
